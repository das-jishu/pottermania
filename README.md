POTTERMANIA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a pet project of mine. It is basically a website which allows you to take a quiz based on the magical world of Harry Potter. What makes it different from other quizzing sites and pages is that I HAVE NOT used a predefined question bank and selected random questions to be displayed. Not a single question has been prewritten and stored. Rather, it generates questions every time the page is loaded. The generation of the questions is based on a simple algorithm which uses an API to fetch data from a database (related to Harry Potter) and some random numbers. Since the amount of information is vast, the chances of getting a question repeated for an user is  very less.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Languages and frameworks used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript(with jQuery).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you face issues regarding the page not loading or the quiz not working as it should, please REFRESH a couple of times and CHECK your internet connection before proceeding.
